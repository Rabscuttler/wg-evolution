## Join our Mailing List

This CHAOSS working group is using the general [CHAOSS mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss).

## Join our Weekly Calls
The Evolution working group meets every other Wednesday at 12:00pm CDT in the CHAOSS Zoom room https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288 (Meeting ID for [dial in](https://unomaha.zoom.us/zoomconference?m=DKGo2mmIuOv9xSjphoGZZmYKxr5HFrS9): 720 431 288, use US phone number 1-408-638-0968 or [international numbers](https://unomaha.zoom.us/zoomconference?m=DKGo2mmIuOv9xSjphoGZZmYKxr5HFrS9)).

## Introduction

### Purpose

_Evolution_ is a working group focused on the lifecycle of open source projects. We do not valence the stages, but seek to build awareness of those stages among consumers of these metrics. Decline can be ok when a project's utility is waning; or terrible if 20% of the entire internet relies on that project. Context matters, and we are not the arbiters of your context. The "valence" of "good/bad" emerges from use cases and YOUR context.

### Goal
Currently, the goals are structured in the following focus areas : [Code Development Activity](focus_areas/code_development_activity.md), [Code Development Efficiency](focus_areas/code_development_efficiency.md) and [Code Development Process Quality](focus_areas/code_development_process_quality.md).

### Process
For each area of interest, we're following the [goal-question-metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQM) methodology defining questions and metrics that help to answer them.

## Roadmap for 2019

Our key focus areas for 2019 are summarized [here](ROADMAP.md).

## Metrics

The evolution metrics dealt with in this working group are organized in focus areas:

Focus Area | Goal
--- | ---
[Code Development Activity](./focus_areas/code_development_activity.md) | Learn about the types and frequency of activities involved in developing code.
[Code Development Efficiency](./focus_areas/code_development_efficiency.md) | Learn how efficiently activities around code development get resolved.
[Code Development Process Quality](./focus_areas/code_development_process_quality.md) | Learn about the processes to improve/review quality that are used (for example: testing, code review, tagging issues, tagging a release, time to response, CII Badging).
[Issue Resolution](./focus_areas/issue_resolution.md) | Identify how effective the community is at addressing issues identified by community participants.
[Community Growth](./focus_areas/community_growth.md) | Identify the size of the project community and whether it is growing, shrinking, or staying the same.

Please note that the work in the focus areas is still in progress.

## Usage

This is a repository for the Evolution working group.
When this working group decides to "release" a version of its metrics, the relevant files will be dumped to the [chaoss/metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics) repository, as a pull request for updating the CHAOSS metrics with "Evolution metrics release x.y".

## Implementations

Examples for implementations can be found [here](implementations).

## Contributing

A few steps as good starting points for contributing to the Evolution Working group:
* Introduce yourself on the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution#mailing-list) explaining your interest.
* Then, you can have a look at the archives of the mailing lists, at the minutes of past meetings, and at the
    * [issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues)
    * [pull requests](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/pulls)
    * [contents of this repository](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution).
* By proposing new goals for a focus area, or new questions for learning about those goals, or new metrics for answering those questions. Or by helping to refine goals, and questions.

You can contribute
See more details in the [contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Communications

### Meetings

The Evolution working group meets frequently. Check details on when we meet, and minutes of past meetings
in the [meetings document](meeting_notes.md).

Usually, we try to make decisions mainly during the last meeting of each month,
so that decisions can be brought when convenient to the monthly main CHAOSS meeting,
which is the first meeting of each month. In all the meetings we may have an agenda,
but random issues can be raised if time allows, after we're done with the agenda.
Whenever possible, and specially if a decision needs to be made,
ensure that issues / pull requests about the subject matter were opened some time before the meeting,
so that anyone had the opportunity of commenting on them, and make up their mind about that subject matter.

### Mailing list

* We use the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://chaoss.community/participate/#user-content-join-the-mailing-list).
Please prefix the message subject with \[wg-evolution\] if it is specific to this working group.
